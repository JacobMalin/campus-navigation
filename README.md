## Attempted Components

- Single Agent Navigation
- Improved Agent & Scene Rendering
- Orientation Smoothing
- Multiple Agents Planning
- Challenge: Crowd Simulation

### Single Agent Navigation

Agents move without overlapping obstacles. To better illustrate the agents' navigation, the bounding circle and path were enabled for one agent.

### Improved Agent & Scene Rendering

Agents were rendered using images of people from a bird's eye perspective. The agents use circular bounding geometry. Obstacles were rendered as complex polygons.
