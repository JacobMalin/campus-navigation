# CSCI 5611 [Project 1](https://github.umn.edu/malin146/Project1)

By: Jacob Malin

This version of the project uses motion planning to simulate crowds of people in two scenes, an apartment and a generic unnamed university campus.

## Attempted Components

- Single Agent Navigation
- Improved Agent & Scene Rendering
- Orientation Smoothing
- Multiple Agents Planning
- Challenge: Crowd Simulation

### Single Agent Navigation

Agents move without overlapping obstacles. To better illustrate the agent's navigation, the bounding circle and path were enabled for one agent.

### Improved Agent & Scene Rendering

Agents were rendered using images of people from a bird's eye perspective. The agents use circular bounding geometry. Obstacles were rendered as complex polygons.

### Orientation Smoothing

Agents were given an orientation with forward being the direction that the eyes of the people models are facing. To show how the rotation corresponds with the agent's path, the agent in the bedroom's path is shown (the blue shirted agent in the bottom left).

### Multiple Agents Planning

Multiple agents are rendered in each scene. Each agent
